scenario_2_behavior_1,"The ego vehicle is turning left at an intersection; the adversarial motorcyclist on the right front pretends to cross the road but brakes abruptly at the edge of the road, causing confusion."
scenario_2_behavior_2,The ego vehicle is turning left at an intersection; the adversarial pedestrian on the opposite sidewalk suddenly crosses the road from the right front and stops in the middle of the intersection.
scenario_2_behavior_3,"The ego vehicle is turning right at an intersection; the adversarial pedestrian on the left front suddenly crosses the road and stops in the middle of the intersection, blocking the ego vehicle's path."
scenario_2_behavior_4,"The ego vehicle is turning left at an intersection; the adversarial cyclist on the left front suddenly stops in the middle of the intersection and dismounts, obstructing the ego vehicle's path."
scenario_2_behavior_5,The ego vehicle is turning right at an intersection; the adversarial motorcyclist on the opposite sidewalk abruptly crosses the road from the right front and comes to a halt in the center of the intersection.
scenario_3_behavior_1,"The ego vehicle is attempting to change lanes to avoid a slow-moving leading vehicle; the adversarial car in the target lane suddenly merges into the ego vehicle's original lane, blocking the ego vehicle from returning to its initial position."
scenario_3_behavior_2,The ego vehicle is changing to the right lane; the adversarial car is driving parallel to the ego and blocking its path.
scenario_3_behavior_3,"The ego vehicle is performing a lane change to evade a slow-moving vehicle; the adversarial car in the target lane on the right front suddenly brakes, causing the ego vehicle to react quickly to avoid a collision."
scenario_3_behavior_4,"The ego vehicle is preparing to change lanes to evade a slow-moving leading vehicle; the adversarial car in the target lane starts weaving between lanes, making it difficult for the ego vehicle to predict its position and safely execute the lane change."
scenario_3_behavior_5,"The ego vehicle is attempting to change lanes to avoid a slow-moving leading vehicle; the adversarial car in the target lane suddenly slows down, matching the speed of the leading vehicle, and effectively blocking the ego vehicle from completing the lane change."
scenario_4_behavior_1,"The ego approaches a parked car that is blocking its lane and must use the opposite lane to bypass the vehicle, cautiously monitoring oncoming traffic, and suddenly encounters a jaywalking pedestrian, requiring the ego to quickly assess the situation and respond appropriately to avoid a collision."
scenario_4_behavior_2,"The ego encounters a parked car blocking its lane and must use the opposite lane to bypass the vehicle, carefully assessing the situation and yielding to oncoming traffic, when an oncoming motorcyclist swerves into the lane unexpectedly, necessitating the ego to brake or maneuver to avoid a potential accident."
scenario_4_behavior_3,"The ego approaches a parked car obstructing its lane and must use the opposite lane to go around when an oncoming car suddenly turns into the ego's path without signaling, requiring the ego to react quickly and take evasive action to prevent a collision."
scenario_4_behavior_4,"The ego encounters a parked car blocking its lane and must use the opposite lane to bypass the vehicle when an oncoming car suddenly accelerates, closing the gap for the ego to safely return to its lane, necessitating the ego to quickly decide whether to accelerate or brake to avoid a collision."
scenario_4_behavior_5,"The ego encounters a parked car blocking its lane and must use the opposite lane to bypass the vehicle when an oncoming pedestrian enters the lane without warning and suddenly stop, necessitating the ego to brake sharply or steer to avoid hitting the pedestrian."
scenario_5_behavior_1,"The ego is driving straight through an intersection when a crossing vehicle runs the red light and unexpectedly accelerates, forcing the ego to quickly reassess the situation and perform a collision avoidance maneuver."
scenario_5_behavior_2,"The ego vehicle is moving straight through the intersection; the adversarial agent, initially on the left front, runs the red light and makes an abrupt right turn, forcing the ego vehicle to perform a collision avoidance maneuver."
scenario_5_behavior_3,"The ego vehicle is moving straight through the intersection; the adversarial agent, initially on the left front, runs the red light and makes an abrupt left turn, forcing the ego vehicle to perform a collision avoidance maneuver."
scenario_5_behavior_4,"The ego moves straight at an intersection when a crossing vehicle runs the red light from right and brakes abruptly, causing the ego to rapidly adapt its trajectory and perform a collision avoidance maneuver."
scenario_5_behavior_5,The ego vehicle is going straight through the intersection; the adversarial vehicle approaches from the left front and cuts off the ego vehicle.
scenario_6_behavior_1,"The ego starts an unprotected left turn at an intersection while yielding to an oncoming car when the oncoming car's throttle malfunctions, leading to an unexpected acceleration and forcing the ego to quickly modify its turning path to avoid a collision."
scenario_6_behavior_2,"The ego attempts an unprotected left turn at an intersection while yielding to an oncoming car when the oncoming car's suddenly brakes, necessitating the ego to rapidly reassess the situation and adjust its turn."
scenario_6_behavior_3,The ego vehicle is making an unprotected left turn; the adversarial vehicle approaches the intersection at a normal speed but then suddenly attempts to make a last-second right turn.
scenario_6_behavior_4,The ego attempts an unprotected left turn at an intersection while yielding to an oncoming car when the oncoming car veer erratically.
scenario_6_behavior_5,"The ego commences an unprotected left turn at an intersection while yielding to an oncoming car when the adversarial car, comes from the right, blocks multiple lanes by driving extremely slowly, forcing the ego vehicle to change lanes."
scenario_7_behavior_1,"The ego is performing a right turn at an intersection when the crossing car suddenly speeds up, entering the intersection and causing the ego to brake abruptly to avoid a collision."
scenario_7_behavior_2,The ego vehicle is turning right; the adversarial car (positioned ahead on the right) blocks the lane by braking suddenly.
scenario_7_behavior_3,The ego vehicle is turning right; the adversarial car (positioned ahead on the right) reverses abruptly.
scenario_7_behavior_4,The ego vehicle is turning right; the adversarial car (positioned behind on the right) suddenly accelerates and then decelerates.
scenario_7_behavior_5,"The ego vehicle is turning right; the adversarial vehicle enters the intersection from the left side, swerving to the right suddenly."
scenario_8_behavior_1,The ego vehicle is approaching the intersection; the adversarial car (on the left) suddenly accelerates and enters the intersection first and suddenly stop.
scenario_8_behavior_2,The ego vehicle is approaching the intersection; the adversarial car (on the right) suddenly accelerates and enters the intersection first and suddenly stop.
scenario_8_behavior_3,"The ego vehicle is entering the intersection; the adversarial vehicle comes from the opposite direction and turns left and stop, causing a near collision with the ego vehicle."
